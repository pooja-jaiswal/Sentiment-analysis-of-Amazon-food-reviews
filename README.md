## Topic: Sentiment analysis of Amazon food reviews 

Dataset: Amazon Fine Food Reviews from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) 

Amazon is an online shopping website where users are encouraged to post product reviews that they purchase. 
The review comments provided by the customers on the product have substantial information about sentiments towards the products they purchased and the use of products. 
The review comments are useful to both other vendors and customers. The sentiment analysis of customer reviews helps the vendor to understand the userâ€™s perspectives. 
They can further use the review comments to improve their products. These reviews are used as a dataset for sentiment analysis in this project.
A typical method to obtain valuable information is to extract the sentiment or opinion from a message. 
Sentiment analysis of product reviews, an application problem, has recently become very popular in text mining and computational linguistics research. 
Machine learning technologies are widely used in sentiment classification because of their ability to learn from the training dataset to predict or support decision making with relatively high accuracy. 
Apache Spark MLlib is one of the most prominent platforms for big data analysis which offers a set of excellent functionalities for different machine learning tasks ranging from regression, classification, and dimension reduction to clustering and rule extraction. 
Apache Spark MLlib is one of the most highly demanded platform-independent and open-source libraries for big data machine learning which benefits from distributed architecture and automatic data parallelization. 

This project utilizes Apache Spark MLlib for sentiment analysis on Amazon food reviews.
